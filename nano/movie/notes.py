#classes are like a blueprint.
#WHAT SHOULD the class movie remember?

#title, type of medium, trailer url, reviews, etc.

#instance: a use of a class. A constructor (the init function) gets called to create the instance of the class.

#all variables associated with an instance are called an instance variable

#instance methods take self as a parameter
